# Friends Webpage with Ruby on Rails

> For this project, I followed the steps and instructions provided by John Elder ([codemy.com](https://codemy.com/)).
> I created a Ruby on Rails application for a webpage that allows a user to Sign Up, Sign Out, Sign In, Add friends' contact information, Edit friends' information, Delete friends' records, and Delete user account.

- A user is allowed to create a new user with a name and last name, email, and password, and to modify the saved data in the future.
- A user can add friends to their list, access the information, edit it, and delete it.
- Works on the browser.
